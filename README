MOOK'S SURF JOURNAL 

Mooks Surf Journal is a full stack application that allows users to log in and record their surf experiances. 

For this project I used the Express framework with node.js mongoDb, Mongoose, JavaScript, and React 

In terms of Icebox features, I want to allow users view other users favorite surf spots, and implement a follow feature. Aditionally, I would like to 
completly restyle the app.
